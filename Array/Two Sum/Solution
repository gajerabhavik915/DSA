#Hint - First I will define Dictionry(Dict1), I will substract one by one value of list from the target.
#      And try to find the answer of substraction into dictionary.
#      If it is not present in dict1, i will add value which i used for substraction. 


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dict1 = dict()
        for a in range(len(nums)):
            main_value = target - nums[a]
            if main_value in dict1:
                return [dict1[main_value], a]
            else:
                dict1[nums[a]] = a
